					Founder David Berkal has a background as both an entrepreneur and as a
					traditional investor. But his time as an investor left him
					disheartened by the short-term mentality of many of these firms.
					Owners were often choosing between two bad options: selling to a
					competitor who was looking to drive profit by cutting costs, or to a
					traditional investment firm, who would resell the business a few years
					down the road. Banyanâ€™s idea was to offer a third option. David raised
					capital from a world-class group of entrepreneurs aligned on a vision
					of a permanent holding company for great software businesses. As a
					private company, Banyan can look beyond quarterly earnings and focus
					on doing the right things over the long-term.
